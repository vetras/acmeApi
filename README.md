# java-getting-started

A barebones Java app, which can easily be deployed to Heroku.  

This application support the [Getting Started with Java on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java) article - check it out.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have Java and Maven installed.  Also, install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/heroku/java-getting-started.git
$ cd java-getting-started
$ mvn install
$ foreman start web
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

If you're going to use a database, ensure you have a local `.env` file that reads something like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/java_database_name
```

## Deploying to Heroku

```sh
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```

## Documentation

## Known Problems

The persistence layer depends directly on the REST dto objects.

We should have separate POJO classes to represent the DB data and map REST DTOs to DB POJOs.
However, on a simple app like this i believe we're OK with removing that layer.
